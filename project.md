Project ideas

- A game would be cool, but I imagine half the class will milk that idea to death.

- Leaning towards building a website that would closely reflect what an actual client would want, i.e. a 'contact us' page with form validation, setting up appointments, interactive design elements, etc.

- Another option I'm considering is making a quiz app that generates questions at random, taken from a database of various questions. There would have to be a key which is then used to grade the quiz.
