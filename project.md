Project idea

Come to the tropics mon

- Tropical island themed website that incorporates a weather API to generate current conditions.

- A basic slideshow showing many awesome pictures of landscape and activities.

- Another option I'm considering is making a quiz that generates questions about the vacation spot at random, taken from a database of various questions.

- A 'get more information/contact us' section complete with input validation.
